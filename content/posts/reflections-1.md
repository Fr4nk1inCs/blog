As the first year of my graduate studies comes to an end, I find myself becoming less and less productive and more and more distracted. Some of this is due to the bad habits I developed in the past 5 years. Although I have acknowledges these issues before, I have never been fixing them. Here I'm going to analyse the flaws of myself, and hopefully I can fix them in a short time.

The flaws of mine have formed a complex system, each of them impacting the others. Some of them are more fundamental, while some of them are more superficial. I will try to analyse them in a layered manner, starting from the most fundamental ones.

- Fundamentals

  - Disrupted life cycle
  - Lack of exercise
  - Thinking without studying
  - Some sort of perfectionism?

    - I always tries the most elegant way possible no matter what context I was in.

  - Monotonous social life
  - Self-undisciplined

- Intermediate
  - Lack of expression
  - Chaotic time management/scheduling
  - Lack of reading (papers)
- Superficial
  - Procrastination
  - Poor health condition
  - Self-unconfidence
  - Not knowledgeable enough

I will try to fix these issues one by one, starting from the most fundamental ones. I will also try to document my progress in this blog, so that I can keep track of my progress and reflect on my journey.
