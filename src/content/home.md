Welcome. I'm Fr4nk1in. I'm a second-year graduate student at [USTC](https://ustc.edu.cn) – [ADSL](https://adsl.ustc.edu.cn). My research focuses on Artificial Intelligence Systems, with a particular interest in LLM inference and Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. Here, I'll be sharing my thoughts, notes, and ideas.
